                  <div class="text"> <h2> DEBUGGING </h2> Debugging is part of how we troubleshoot a program. In debugging, it jumps on every line in the program and shows you whether it is working or not. There are also Step-by-Step Program Executions in Debugging, and these are Resume, Step Into, Step Over, and Step Out. During the time we were doing this lesson, I struggled to find these tools because they were small icons and were new to me. In the end, I calmed myself, and guess what? It was right in front of my face all along.

                  <div class="text"> <h2> .NET </h2> The only thing that I feel was the most memorable and satisfying during our coverage of .NET was inputting “dotnet run” in our code, which isn’t even found in Visual Studio, or so I’ve recalled. Witnessing our complex codes run in real time was definitely quite a joy, in my opinion. The rest of the .NET stuff, however, I prefer not to touch or comment on. Wrapping my head around this programming stuff was taxing, but it was still very insightful nonetheless.

                  <div class="text"> <h2> JAVASCRIPT </h2> What I liked most about learning JavaScript was its ability to manipulate and move the content of a website seamlessly. For instance, one of our lessons involved creating a function that calculates the mean temperature from a list of temperature values. At first, I thought it would be difficult because I wasn’t very familiar with JavaScript, but seeing how it could process data and update web content dynamically was fascinating.

                  <div class="text"> <h2> CSS </h2> What I like the most about this subject is CSS. Why? It’s because CSS is about designing your webpage through extensive coding; you can adjust an image size, image placement, and changing colors; you get the point. Since I’m a BMMA student, of course CSS is my favorite part, as I am an artist myself. DESIGN = ART, and I am all about that life!. CSS offers many things to web designers; you can even animate in it!

                  <div class="text"> <h2> HTML </h2> HTML is one of the basic things I know, but I still lack some information needed to achieve a pleasing outcome on my webpages. I also learned about JavaScript, which presented a challenge but resulted in more pleasing arrangements of words, images, and lines on my webpages. I discovered that there are software tools available that make it easier to use, as they provide shortcuts for applying the necessary code, leading to faster and better performance.
