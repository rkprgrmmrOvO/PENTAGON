            <h1> DEBUGGING </h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Camero, John Niel S., a Bachelor in Multimedia Arts (BMMA) student from the
            Systems Technology Institute's (STI) Cubao branch, and as you can see, I took this web
            programming course.</p> <br> <br>
            <p>I learned a lot from web programming, from HTML to .NET, but what I want to tell you
            is that one of the most important pieces of building a web page is debugging. Debugging is part
            of troubleshooting in the program.</p> <br> <br>
            <p>But before that, we have Errors, where a web page cannot function properly due to either
            the programmer’s misconception when solving a problem, improper use and typos of the
            programming language, or the inability to predict user behavior. These errors can be in the form
            of SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, and RangeError. If you have Visual Studio
            Code, this software will automatically show you these errors by highlighting them in red. In my
            personal experience, we always start coding the HTML in Notepad before anywhere else, where
            you better watch out for these errors because it will not tell you if there are errors, unlike in
            Visual Studio Code.</p> <br> <br>
            <p>To surely clean our program, aside from finding and solving the errors, we will now test
            if each code is functioning correctly with Debugging. Like what I’ve said earlier, this is part of
            how we troubleshoot the program. In debugging, it jumps on every line in the program and
            shows you whether it is working or not. There are also Step-by-Step Program Executions in
            Debugging, and these are Resume, Step Into, Step Over, and Step Out. During the time we
            were doing this lesson, I struggled to find these tools because they were small icons and were
            new to me. In the end, I calmed myself, and guess what? It was right in front of my face all
            along.</p> <br> <br>
            <p>What I shared with you is all about troubleshooting, so if you have a problem in your
            program, try to find the errors and test them together with debugging. I missed the time when we
            were doing this: my friends mocking and making fun of each other due to our errors in our code,
            and eventually troubleshooting and correcting them. From here on out, I want to say it’s been an
            honor to have been taught this course, and I will continue exploring it for personal satisfaction.</p> </div>
