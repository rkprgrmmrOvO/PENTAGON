            <p>Greetings! My name is Mark Angelo Malano, and I am from BMMA401. Learning about
                JavaScript has been a truly enjoyable experience. JavaScript is a programming language
                designed to make web pages interactive. It can perform a wide range of tasks, such as showing
                alerts, creating animations, and updating content dynamically without needing to reload the
                entire page. In essence, JavaScript is what transforms static HTML and CSS into engaging,
                responsive user experiences, making websites dynamic and fun to use. </p> <br><br>
                <p>What I liked most about learning JavaScript was its ability to manipulate and move the
                content of a website seamlessly. For instance, one of our lessons involved creating a function that
                calculates the mean temperature from a list of temperature values. At first, I thought it would be
                difficult because I wasnâ€™t very familiar with JavaScript, but seeing how it could process data and
                update web content dynamically was fascinating. Understanding how JavaScript interacts with
                the Document Object Model (DOM) opens up endless possibilities for creating interactive
                elements like sliders, form validations, and real-time content updates. These practical
                applications demonstrated just how essential JavaScript is for modern web development. </p> <br><br>
                <p>Learning JavaScript seemed complicated and unrelated to my interests at first, which
                made it seem difficult. Still, my perspective changed as I listened more about it. Writing
                interactive elements went from being a challenge to a source of fascination as the syntax became
                understandable. Our lecturer was essential, providing clear explanations and useful examples that
                helped make concepts understandable. Having a solid foundation in JavaScript basics, such as
                variable declarations, function syntax, and the return statement, was important. In short, I
                developed a deep appreciation for the dynamic nature of web development and increased my
                technical skills. Gaining knowledge of JavaScript was fun and improved my perspective and
                abilities.</p> <br> <br>
